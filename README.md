## üß≠ About Me

I am an accomplished **Robotics Engineer** with a strong foundation in **Electrical and Electronics Engineering** and a passion for **intelligent marine robotics**. My journey has taken me from achieving Summa Cum Laude honors in my Bachelor's degree at AIUB, to advancing my expertise through the Erasmus Mundus Master‚Äôs program in Marine & Maritime Intelligent Robotics in France and Spain.

I have hands-on experience in automation and R&D, having worked on various projects that improved operational efficiency, reduced downtime, and advanced the integration of AI in industrial settings. My research has been recognized with 12 published papers, and I am eager to continue pushing the boundaries of technology.

### üîç **Objective**  
I am seeking a summer internship where I can apply my skills in a dynamic manufacturing environment, contribute to industrial engineering advancements, and explore the frontier of AI integration.
